## Combined model

- [ANLP_final_NN.ipynb](ANLP_final_NN.ipynb) consist of the collection of models that we planned to use to solve the problem of Textual Entailment. They were later evaluated and tested in the file "ANLP_final_NN_Tunning_simple_LSTM_KERAS.ipynb". The results can be seen after testing.
